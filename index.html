      <h2 class="style-quote">How long will my website take?</h2>
      <p>The truth is, it depends. The complexity of each website will vary, which means the time it takes to complete
        will as well. After discussing your specific project requirements, there will be a clear projection of the
        delivery of your website. We may choose to begin with a content management system, or build everything from
        scratch. We are happy to offer assistance from proof of concept, throughout the production process, upon
        delivery, as well as continued website maintenance. We look forward to working with you!</p>
